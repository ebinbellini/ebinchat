		use it. If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate
		to contact us.

	</h3>

	<h2>Data Echeveria collects</h2>
	<h3>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>
				Your account information, such as your password, email, username, profile picture, and your friendlist.
			</li>
			<li>
				Data that is shared with other users, such as the contents of the messages you send through our service
				and your friend requests.
			</li>
			<li>
				Non-user-identifiable information: the number of visitors for different periods and database
				usage volume.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email
				address, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other
				information you may choose to provide.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</h3>

	<h2>How we use your information</h2>
	<h3>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>
				The A class data, that is account information, is used for logging in, sending password reset emails,
				displaying your profile picture and username for other users, and so on.
			</li>
			<li>
				The B class data is not used for anything else than delivering messages and notifications to the users
				they are sent to. However, the browser usually uses a third party service to deliver the notification.
			</li>
			<li>
				The C class data is used to monitor server health. We will only use this data to detect if something has
				gone wrong.
			</li>
			<li>
				The D class data is hard to say anything about since it could contain anything,
			</li>
		</ol>
		None of the information is shared with third parties, except for the B class data, as explained above.
	</h3>

	<h2>
		Cookies

	<h3>
		The Echeveria site does not use cookies. The service still works if you disable cookies through a browser
		setting.

	<h2>
		GDPR Data Protection Rights

	<h3>
		We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to

			<li>
				The right to rectification – You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe
				is inaccurate. You also have the right to request that we complete the information you believe is
				incomplete. This is not applicable as we do not publish information.

				The right to erasure – You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain
				conditions.
			</li>
			<li>
				The right to restrict processing – You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your

			<li>
				The right to object to processing – You have the right to object to our processing of your personal
				data, under certain conditions. This is not applicable for our service because we do not process your

				collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.

		your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately
		and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.
