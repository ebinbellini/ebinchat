	<h1>Echeveria Terms of Service</h1>
	<h2>What’s covered in these terms</h2>
	<h3>
		<ul>
			<li>What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our service </li>
			<li>What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our service</li>
			<li>In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in
				case someone violates these terms</li>
		</ul>

		Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.
		<br>
		<br>
		Besides these terms, we also have a <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. Although it’s not part of these
		terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how we handle the data you give us and how you can
		manage, and delete your information.

	</h3>

	<h2>Your relationship with Echeveria and Ebin Bellini</h2>
	<h3>
		Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect
		how Echeveria works. When we speak of “Echeveria,” “we,” “us," “our,” and only in this paragraph "he," we mean
		the
		main author of this website, Ebin Bellini, who is not a legal person but rather a fictional entity. He can be
		reached via the email adress <a href="mailto:ebinbellini@airmail.cc">ebinbellini@airmail.cc</a>, which is his
		preferred method of communication.
	</h3>

	<h2>What you can expect from us</h2>
	<h3>
		This service is provided as-is with a warranty described under the subtitle "Warranty" in addition to other
		parts of these terms. Echeveria is, however, under no legal obligation to provide you with service, and may at
		any time waive the rights described in these terms from any user or group.
	</h3>

	<h2>Third party services</h2>
	<h3>
		Echeveria uses a MySQL database which is a Free as in Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS).
		<!--Our services contain software offered under the GPL free software license. Sometimes there are provisions in the
			open source license that explicitly take precedence over some of these terms, so be sure to read the license. It
			is avaliable <a href="/LICENSE">here</a>.-->
	</h3>

	<h2>Your usage of Echeveria</h2>
	<h3>
		Our services allow you to interact with others. We want to maintain a
		respectful environment, which means you must follow these basic rules
		of conduct: comply with applicable laws, including export control,
		sanctions, and human trafficking laws. Respect the rights of others,
		including privacy and intellectual property rights. Don’t abuse or harm
		others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for
		example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or
		stalking others. Don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the
		services. You are responsible for everything that you do using the
		Echeveria service.
		<br>
		<br>
		Although we give you permission to use our services, and read and
		contribute to our source code, we retain any intellectual property rights
		we have in the services.
	</h3>

	<h2>
		Warranty
	</h2>
	<h3>
		We provide our services with at least a bit of expertise and care. If we do not live up to the quality level you
		expect, you agree to notify us via <a href="mailto:ebinbellini@airmail.cc">ebinbellini@airmail.cc</a> so that we
		can resolve the issue with you.
	</h3>

	<h2>
		Our responsibilities
	</h2>
	<h3>
		These terms only limit our obligations to the extent permitted by applicable law. More specifically, these terms
		do not limit Echeveria's liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent representation, gross
		negligence or willful negligence, just to name a few.
		<br>
		<br>
		In addition to the rights and obligations described in this section (in the event of a problem or disagreement),
		Echeveria shall have no liability for any loss, unless caused by our violation of these terms.
	</h3>

	<h2>About these terms</h2>
	<h3>
		By law, some of your rights cannot be restricted by an agreement such as these terms. We do not intend to limit
		such rights in any way with these terms.
		<br>
		<br>
		In these terms, we describe the relationship between you and Echeveria. The Terms do not confer any legal rights
		on other persons or organizations, although such relationship may be beneficial to others in accordance with
		these terms.
		<br>
		<br>
		If it turns out that a certain condition is not valid or enforceable, this should not affect any other
		conditions.
		<br>
		<br>
		If we fail to comply with these terms and we do not take immediate action, that does not mean that we waive any
		of our rights, such as taking action in the future.

		We may update these terms and conditions (1) to reflect changes in our
		services - for example, when we add new featuresor remove old ones,
		(2) for legal or regulatory or safety reasons, or (3) to prevent
		unauthorized use or damage.
